 OpenLIBM contains code that is covered by various licenses. 
 .
 The OpenLIBM code derives from the FreeBSD msun implementation, which
 in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3. As a result, it has a number of fixes
 and updates that have accumulated over the years in msun, and also
 optimized assembly versions of many functions. These improvements are
 provided under the BSD license. The msun library also includes work
 placed under the public domain, whih is noted in the individual
 files. Further work on making a standalone OpenLIBM library from msun,
 as part of the Julia project is covered under the MIT license.
