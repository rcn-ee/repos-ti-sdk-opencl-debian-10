libloki for Debian
==================

Loki is the library which evolved from the code accompanying the (truly
excellent) book "Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns
Applied" by Andrei Alexandrescu. On the book's homepage[0], you may find two
sample chapters, additional information (errata, etc.), as well as a link to
a (non-free) online version.

If I may inject at this point: buy the book! It's one of the best acquisitions
for the serious C++ programmer and probably the best C++ book I've ever held
in my hands.

Using Loki on Debian
--------------------

First off, all header files have been moved from /usr/include to
/usr/include/loki, which means that you should include the directory in the
include directive. E.g.:

  #include <loki/TypeTraits.h>

Note that you have to tell the linker about the library *after* all
object files have been specified:

  ld -o myproj src.o -lloki
